### Preliminaries
#### Matrices
* Is a function which takes in an input and gives an output
* Usually applies a "transformation" to the input
* Can also be a composition of sequential transformations

#### Projection transformation
* A matrix which when multiplied to any vector projects that vector to its closest point on a particular subspace
* By virtue it also compresses the vector to a lower dimension

#### Matrix inverse
* The matrix which applies the opposite transformation to the original matrix
* Unfortunately this isnt unique

#### Eigenvectors/ Eigenvalues of matrix
* Vector which only undergoes scales after matrix transformation but maintains direction
* Eigen value is the scaling constant for the eigen vector

#### Rectangular matrices
* Rectangular matrices can add or subtract a dimension when applied to a vector

#### Symmetric matrices
* Special property that eigen vectors are orthogonal
* So if we take eigen vectors and put them into a matrix then transpose of that transforms eigen vectors to align with standard basis
* If we dont take transpose that matrix transforms standard basis to eigen vectors

#### AA^T
* This gives us a symmetric matrix from a non symmetric matrix

#### Singular value decomposition
* Any matrix can be represented as a matrix multiplication of three special matrices
